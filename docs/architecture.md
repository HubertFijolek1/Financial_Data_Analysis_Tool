- **Database Service:** PostgreSQL container storing financial and external data.
- **Data Processing Modules:** Modules for aggregation, trend analysis, reporting, and alerting.
- **CI/CD:** Automated via GitHub Actions.
- **Deployment:** Managed with Docker Compose on a Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) environment.
